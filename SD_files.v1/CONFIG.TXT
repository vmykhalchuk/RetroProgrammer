# If DIR_NAME missed, PROG_ID DIR NAME is used instead!
# Same if no record found in config.txt

# If File name is missing, MAIN.HRP is used by default

# Backups are stored in BACKUPS folder. So no DIR_NAME should be named with this name!

#>>> Autogeneration of directory name by PROG_ID
# If no record found for given PROG_ID, then directory name will be auto-generated
# for MN_XXXX, R1_X, R2_XXX directory will be named exactly as PROG_ID
# for ID_XXXXYYYYYYYY - directory will be composed of two directories (main dir and sub dir), where
#	main dir = ID_XXXX.___
#	sub dir  = YYYYYYYY
